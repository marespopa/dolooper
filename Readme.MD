# Dolooper

## Why does this app exist?

Some hard truth. Multitasking doesn't work. You probably know the story of the hunter who tries to shoot two rabbits at the same time. In case you don't, let me share with you the end result. He gets out with no rabbit. That's the same with our development. If we try to focus on more than one task at a time, we rarely give out our best effort.

## Looking to increase your productivity?

Dolooper comes out to help you. You are allowed to work on only one task at a time. So-called multitasking divides our attention. For example, in studies, attempting to complete additional tasks during a driving simulation led to poorer driving performance.

It helps break down the issue into smaller pieces and distribute tasks when applicable. Even if you're the only one facing the dilemma, planning turns a larger, more abstract thing into bite-sized activities. It forces you to set an estimation to your task.

By defining upfront how long a task will take, you fight procrastination, which helps with focusing on the task at hand. It also helps ignore distractions and prioritize it since there is a deadline to be met.
